//logic for the request form Jordan...

//on the one hand, we need to update members in a role...
//role = nftVoters
//with all the people who hold NFTs...
//proposalkind::AddMemberToRole();
//but it is important to allow this to be done with requirng votes...
//so we update the policy to create a new role...    the NFTMemberManagerRole
//to do this we need to know how to use                 ...ChangePolicy...
//so we have a designated role that can only add people the NFTVoters role...
//the specific outcome of the policy would be something like...


  //how can we make it safe... so no one else can add another member to this role?
  //how can we make it manageable so a council can change this?
  //we should make it so that only the council can modify this role...
  //depends on structure of DAO I suppose...
  //


  //we want the NFTMemberManagerRole to only have permisisons to modify the members in a specific policy...
  //i.e. the NFTVoters Policy....
